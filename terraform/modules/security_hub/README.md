# 🛡️ Security Hub Module - Centralized Security Management

## 📚 **What is Security Hub?**

**Security Hub** is AWS's **centralized security service** that provides a comprehensive view of your security posture across all AWS accounts and services. Think of it as a **security command center** that collects, analyzes, and prioritizes security findings from multiple sources.

### **🏠 Real-World Analogy**

- **🛡️ Security Hub** = A security operations center (SOC) for your cloud
- **📊 Central Dashboard** = One screen showing all security issues
- **🔍 Finding Aggregation** = Collects alerts from all your security tools
- **📈 Security Score** = Overall health rating of your security posture
- **🚨 Automated Response** = Triggers actions when threats are detected
- **📋 Compliance Reports** = Documentation for audits and regulations

---

## 🎯 **What This Module Creates**

This module sets up **Security Hub centralized security management** for your security lab:

- **🛡️ Security Hub** - The main security management service
- **🔍 Finding Aggregation** - Collects security findings from all sources
- **📊 Security Standards** - Enables security compliance frameworks
- **🚨 Automated Actions** - Responds to security threats automatically
- **📧 SNS Integration** - Sends security alerts and notifications
- **🏷️ Tags** - Organization and cost tracking

## 📝 **Input Variables Explained**

### **🏷️ Environment and Naming**

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name for tagging and naming"
  type        = string
  default     = "lab"
}
```

**What this means:** All Security Hub resources get tagged with your environment (dev, staging, prod)

### **🌍 AWS Region**

```hcl
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region where Security Hub will be enabled"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}
```

**What this means:** Security Hub will be enabled in this specific AWS region

### **📧 SNS Configuration**

```hcl
variable "sns_topic_arn" {
  description = "ARN of SNS topic for Security Hub findings"
  type        = string
}
```

**What this means:** Security Hub will send security alerts to this SNS topic

### **🔍 Security Standards**

```hcl
variable "enable_security_standards" {
  description = "List of security standards to enable"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["cis-aws-foundations-benchmark", "pci-dss", "aws-foundational-security-best-practices"]
}
```

**What this means:** Defines which security compliance frameworks to enable

---

## 🔍 **How It Works (Step by Step)**

### **Step 1: Enable Security Hub**

```hcl
resource "aws_securityhub_account" "main" {
  enable_default_standards = false  # We'll enable specific standards
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-security-hub"
    Environment = var.environment
    Service     = "Security Hub"
  }
}
```

**What this does:** Enables Security Hub in your AWS account with custom configuration

### **Step 2: Enable Security Standards**

```hcl
resource "aws_securityhub_standards_subscription" "standards" {
  for_each = toset(var.enable_security_standards)
  
  standards_arn = "arn:aws:securityhub:${var.region}::standards/${each.value}/v/1.0.0"
  
  depends_on = [aws_securityhub_account.main]
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-${each.value}-standard"
    Environment = var.environment
    Standard    = each.value
  }
}
```

**What this does:** Enables specific security compliance frameworks:
- **CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark** - Industry best practices
- **PCI DSS** - Payment card industry security standards
- **AWS Foundational Security Best Practices** - AWS security recommendations

### **Step 3: Create Action Target**

```hcl
resource "aws_securityhub_action_target" "automated_response" {
  name        = "${var.environment}-automated-response"
  description = "Automated response actions for security findings"
  identifier  = "AutomatedResponse"
  
  depends_on = [aws_securityhub_account.main]
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-automated-response-target"
    Environment = var.environment
    Type        = "Automation"
  }
}
```

**What this means:** Creates a target for automated security responses

### **Step 4: Configure Finding Aggregation**

```hcl
resource "aws_securityhub_finding_aggregator" "main" {
  linking_mode = "ALL_REGIONS"
  
  depends_on = [aws_securityhub_account.main]
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "${var.environment}-finding-aggregator"
    Environment = var.environment
    Type        = "Aggregation"
  }
}
```

**What this does:** Aggregates security findings from all AWS regions into one view

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **🚨 Error: "Security Hub already enabled"**
**Solution:** Security Hub can only be enabled once per account. Use `data` source instead of `resource`.

### **🚨 Error: "Insufficient permissions"**
**Solution:** Ensure your AWS user/role has Security Hub permissions:
- `securityhub:EnableSecurityHub`
- `securityhub:CreateInsight`
- `securityhub:CreateActionTarget`

### **🚨 Error: "Standard not found"**
**Solution:** Check that the security standard name is correct and available in your region.

### **🚨 Error: "Finding aggregation failed"**
**Solution:** Ensure Security Hub is enabled in all regions before configuring aggregation.
