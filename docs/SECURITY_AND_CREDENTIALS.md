# Security and Credentials Management

This guide covers essential security practices and credential management for your AWS Security Lab.

## Overview

Security is the foundation of any cloud environment. This guide teaches you how to:
- Manage AWS credentials securely
- Implement security best practices
- Monitor and audit access
- Respond to security incidents

## AWS Credentials Overview

### Types of Credentials

1. **Root Account Credentials**
   - Your main AWS account email and password
   - **Never use for daily operations**
   - Only for account management and billing

2. **IAM User Credentials**
   - Individual user accounts with specific permissions
   - Username/password for console access
   - Access keys for programmatic access

3. **IAM Role Credentials**
   - Temporary credentials for specific tasks
   - No long-term access keys to manage
   - Automatically rotated by AWS

4. **Access Keys**
   - Programmatic access to AWS services
   - Consist of Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
   - Used by applications, scripts, and CLI tools

## Creating Secure Credentials

### IAM User Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**
   ```
   Good: security-lab-admin, security-lab-developer
   Bad: user1, admin, test
   ```

2. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Require MFA for all users
   - Use hardware tokens or authenticator apps
   - Never disable MFA for production accounts

3. **Follow Least Privilege Principle**
   - Only grant necessary permissions
   - Start with minimal access and add as needed
   - Regular permission reviews

### Access Key Security

1. **Generate Unique Keys per Purpose**
   ```
   security-lab-cli-key
   security-lab-script-key
   security-lab-application-key
   ```

2. **Set Expiration Dates**
   - Rotate keys every 90 days
   - Use IAM policies to enforce expiration
   - Monitor key usage

3. **Secure Storage**
   - Never commit keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or secure credential stores
   - Encrypt keys at rest

## Environment Configuration

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Copy the Template**
   ```bash
   cp env.template .env.lab
   ```

2. **Configure Your Credentials**
   ```bash
   # .env.lab
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_12_digit_account_id
   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

3. **Load Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   Get-Content .env.lab | ForEach-Object { if($_ -match "^([^=]+)=(.*)$") { [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($matches[1], $matches[2], "Process") } }
   
   # Linux/macOS
   export $(cat .env.lab | xargs)
   ```

### AWS CLI Configuration

1. **Configure AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Use Named Profiles**
   ```bash
   aws configure --profile security-lab
   ```

3. **Switch Between Profiles**
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls --profile security-lab
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### Network Security

1. **Use Private Subnets**
   - Place sensitive resources in private subnets
   - Use NAT Gateways for outbound internet access
   - Implement proper security group rules

2. **Security Group Configuration**
   - Restrict access to necessary ports only
   - Use specific IP ranges, not 0.0.0.0/0
   - Regular security group reviews

3. **VPC Flow Logs**
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
   - Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
   - Integrate with GuardDuty for threat detection

### Data Security

1. **Encryption at Rest**
   - Enable S3 bucket encryption
   - Use EBS encryption for volumes
   - Encrypt RDS databases

2. **Encryption in Transit**
   - Use HTTPS for web traffic
   - Enable TLS for database connections
   - Use AWS Certificate Manager for SSL certificates

3. **Access Logging**
   - Enable S3 access logging
   - Enable CloudTrail for API logging
   - Monitor access patterns

### Identity and Access Management

1. **Regular Access Reviews**
   - Monthly user access reviews
   - Remove unused permissions
   - Document access justifications

2. **Privileged Access Management**
   - Limit admin access to essential users
   - Use temporary elevated permissions
   - Monitor privileged actions

3. **Cross-Account Access**
   - Use IAM roles for cross-account access
   - Implement proper trust relationships
   - Regular cross-account permission reviews

## Monitoring and Alerting
